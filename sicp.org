* Building Abstractions With Procedures
A computational process, in a correctly working computer, executes programs precisely and accurately. 

*** Why Lisp
- Lisp descriptions of processes, called procedures, can themselves be represented and manipulated as Lisp data.
- The ability to represent procedures as data also makes Lisp an excellent language for writing programs that must manipulate other programs as data, such as the interpreters and compilers that support computer languages.
- It's great fun

** The Elements of Programming

The language serves as a framework within which we organize our ideas about processes. Languages have three mechanisms by which they express this:
- *primitive expressions*, which represent the simplest entities the language is concerned with,
- *means of combination*, by which compound elements are built from simpler ones, and
- *means of abstraction*, by which compound elements can be named and manipulated as units.

In programming, we deal with two kinds of elements: procedures and data.
- *data* data is “stuff” that we want to manipulate
- *procedures* are descriptions of the rules for manipulating the data.

*** Expressions
- Expressions can be as simple as a number.
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme :exports both
2
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: 2

- Expressions can be combined with primitive procedures (+ * etc...)
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme :exports both
(+ 2 3)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: 5

- .. and these can be combined into Combinations
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme :exports both
(+ 5 (- 3 2) (* 7 6))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: 48

*** Naming and Environment

Define is our language’s simplest means of abstraction, for it allows us to use simple names to refer to the results of compound operations.

It should be clear that the possibility of associating values with symbols and later retrieving them means that the interpreter must maintain some sort of memory that keeps track of the name-object pairs. This memory is called the environment (more precisely the global environment, since we will see later that a computation may involve a number of different environments).9

*** Evaluating Combinations
To evaluate a combination, do the following:
- Evaluate the subexpressions of the combination.
- Apply the procedure that is the value of the leftmost subexpression (the operator) to the arguments that are the values of the other subexpressions (the operands). 

#+BEGIN_SRC scheme :exports both
(* (+ 2 (* 4 6)) (+ 3 5 7))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: 390

For example the above expression requires that the evaluation rule be applied to four different combinations. 

#+BEGIN_SRC plantuml :file images/1.1.png :exports results
:390;
split
:*>
detach
split again
:26;
split
:+>
detach
split again
:2;
detach
split again
:24;
split
:*>
detach
split again
:4;
detach
split again
:6;
detach
end split
end split
split again
:15;
split
:+>
detach
split again
:3;
detach
split again
:5;
detach
split again
:7;
detach
#+END_SRC 

#+RESULTS:
[[file:images/1.1.png]]

The “percolate values upward” form of the evaluation rule is an example of a general kind of process known as tree accumulation.

Next, observe that the repeated application of the first step brings us to the point where we need to evaluate, not combinations, but primitive expressions such as numerals, built-in operators, or other names. We take care of the primitive cases by stipulating that
- the values of numerals are the numbers that they name,
- the values of built-in operators are the machine instruction sequences that carry out the corresponding operations, and
- the values of other names are the objects associated with those names in the environment.

Notice that the evaluation rule given above does not handle definitions. For instance, evaluating (define x 3) does not apply define to two arguments

Such exceptions to the general evaluation rule are called *special forms*.

The evaluation rule for expressions can be described by a simple general rule together with specialized rules for a small number of special forms.

*** Compound Procedures
 *Procedure* definitions are  a much more powerful abstraction technique by which a compound operation can be given a name and then referred to as a unit. 

This is expressed in our language as:

#+BEGIN_SRC scheme :exports code :session compound-procedures :results silent
(define (square x) (* x x))
#+END_SRC

Having defined ~square~ we can now use it:

#+BEGIN_SRC scheme :exports both :session compound-procedures
(square 4)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: 16

We can also now use square inside of definitions of other procedures.

#+BEGIN_SRC scheme :exports both :session compound-procedures
(define (sum-of-squares x y)
(+ (square x) (square y)))

(sum-of-squares 3 4)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: 25

Of course, now we can use ~sum-of-squares~ as a building block for constructing furthur procedures.

#+BEGIN_SRC scheme :exports both :session compound-procedures
(define (f a)
(sum-of-squares (+ a 1) (* a 2)))

(f 5)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: 136

Compound procedures are used in exactly the same way as primitive procedures. Indeed, one could not tell by looking at the definition of sum-of-squares given above whether square was built into the interpreter, like + and *, or defined as a compound procedure. 

*** The Substitution Model for Procedure Application
**** Applicative Order Evaluation
To apply a compound procedure to arguments, evaluate the body of the procedure with each formal parameter replaced by the corresponding argument. 

Take our expression: 

~(f 5)~ 

Substitute the body of f

~(sum-of-squares (+ a 1) (* a 2))~

Then we replace the formal parameter ~a~ with ~5~

~(sum-of-squares (+ 5 1) (* 5 2)~

We must evaluate the operator to get the procedure to be applied, and we must evaluate the operands to get the arguments.

~(+ (square 6) (square 10))~

This reduces to:

~(+ (* 6 6) (* 10 10))~

Which reduces by multiplication to:

~(+ 36 10)~

and finally to:

~136~

**** Normal Order Evaluation
This is not the only way to perform evaluation. An alternative evaluation model would not evaluate the operands until their values were needed. Instead it would first substitute operand expressions for parameters until it obtained an expression involving only primitive operators, and would then perform the evaluation. 

~(sum-of-squares (+ 5 1) (* 5 2))~

~(+ (square (+ 5 1)) (square (* 5 2)))~

~(+ (* (+ 5 1) (+ 5 1)) (* (* 5 2) (* 5 2)))~

Then it's followed by reductions

~(+ (* 6 6) (* 10 10))~

~(+ 36 100)~

~136~

**** Applicative order versus normal order
It can be shown that, for procedure applications that can be modeled using substitution (including all the procedures in the first two chapters of this book) and that yield legitimate values, normal-order and applicative-order evaluation produce the same value.

Lisp uses applicative order, note having to evaluate the same expression twice in the normal-order expansion.

*** Conditional Expressions and Predicates

$$|x| = \begin{cases}
x & if & x > 0 \\
0 & if & x = 0 \\
-x & if & x < 0
\end{cases}$$

This construct is called a case analysis, and there is a special form in Lisp for notating such a case analysis. It is called cond (which stands for “conditional”), and it is used as follows: 

#+BEGIN_SRC scheme :results silent exports: code
(define (abs x)
  (cond ((> x 0) x)
        ((= x 0) 0)
        ((< x 0) (- x))))
(abs 3)
#+END_SRC

Conditional expressions are evaluated as follows. The predicate ⟨ p 1 ⟩ is evaluated first. If its value is false, then ⟨ p 2 ⟩ is evaluated. If ⟨ p 2 ⟩ ’s value is also false, then ⟨ p 3 ⟩ is evaluated. This process continues until a predicate is found whose value is true, in which case the interpreter returns the value of the corresponding consequent expression ⟨ e ⟩ of the clause as the value of the conditional expression. If none of the ⟨ p ⟩ ’s is found to be true, the value of the cond is undefined.

*Predicates* are procedures that return true or false.

Another way to define absolute-value:

#+BEGIN_SRC scheme :results silent exports: code
(define (abs x)
  (cond ((< x 0) (- x))
        (else x))
#+END_SRC

And one more:

#+BEGIN_SRC scheme :results silent exports: code
(define (abs x)
  (if (< x 0)
      (- x)
      x))
#+END_SRC

If is a restricted type of conditional that can be used when there are precisely two cases in the case analysis.

**** Exercise 1.2 :exercise:

Translate the following expression into prefix form:

$$5 + 4 + ( 2 − ( 3 − ( 6 + \frac{4}{5}) \over 3 ( 6 − 2 ) ( 2 − 7 )$$

#+BEGIN_SRC scheme :exports code
(/ (+ 5 4 (- 2 (- 3 (+ 6 (/ 4 5)))))
   (* 3 (- 6 2) (- 2 7)))
#+END_SRC

**** Exercise 1.3 :exercise:

Define a procedure that takes three numbers as arguments and returns the sum of the squares of the two larger numbers.

#+BEGIN_SRC scheme :exports code :results silent :session ex1.3
;; we'll redefine our above functions in this code session
(define (square x) (* x x))

(define (sum-of-squares x y) (+ (square x) (square y)))

(define (sum-of-squares-of-largest x y z)
  (cond ((and (< x y) (< x z)) (sum-of-squares y z))
        ((and (< y z) (< y z)) (sum-of-squares x z))
        ((and (< z y) (< z x)) (sum-of-squares x y))))
#+END_SRC

Let's try the function

#+BEGIN_SRC scheme :exports both :session ex1.3
(= 13 (sum-of-squares-of-largest 1 2 3))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: #t

**** Exercise 1.4 :exercise:

Observe that our model of evaluation allows for combinations whose operators are compound expressions. Use this observation to describe the behavior of the following procedure: 

#+BEGIN_SRC scheme :exports code :results silent
(define (a-plus-abs-b a b)
((if (> b 0) + -) a b))
#+END_SRC

Here either a plus operation or a minus opertaion is returned depeneding on the positive-ness or negative-ness of ~b~.

**** Exercise 1.5                                               :exercise:

Ben Bitdiddle has invented a test to determine whether the interpreter he is faced with is using applicative-order evaluation or normal-order evaluation. He defines the following two procedures:
 
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme :exports code :results silent
(define (p) (p))

(define (test x y) 
  (if (= x 0) 
      0 
      y))
#+END_SRC

Here either a plus operation or a minus opertaion is returned depeneding on the positive-ness or negative-ness of ~b~.

Then he evaluates the expression
#+BEGIN_SRC scheme :exports code :results silent
(test 0 (p))
#+END_SRC

***** Applicative-Order
~(test 0 (p))~\\
~(test 0 (p))~\\
***** Normal Order
~(test 0 (p))~\\
~((if (= 0 0) 0 (p))~\\
~(if #t 0 (p))~\\
~0~
